Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.

The short-term sketches are:

Sketch1 - Each of the circle represents from smallest to biggest: seconds, minutes, and hours. Like a clock, the starting point of each circle is at the top. The position indicates its completion of a full cycle. While the seconds and minutes both have 60 steps, the hours only has 24.

Sketch2- Three bars side by side indicate from left to right: hours, minutes, and seconds. The amount of fill/size of blue in this case indicates the completion of a full cycle. Once it completes one cycle, it will start from empty again. Once again, the full cycle is 60 steps for seconds and minutes and 24 for hours.

Sketch3 - The three triangles from largest to smallest indicate hours, minutes, and seconds. The starting/ending point is the upright position and the orientation of the tip indicates the completion of each cycle. Finally, the cycle is once again indicated by 60 steps for seconds and minutes and 24 for hours.


Long-term sketches are:

Sketch4- Days(7), weeks(4), and months(12) are measured by the size of the glow, the rotation of the star, and the color of the circle respectively.

Sketch5- Days(7), weeks(4), and months(12) are measured by the position of the circle, the rotation of the square, and the color of the circle respectively. In this way, it acts like the square rotating causes the circle to fall and the cycle repeats itself.

Sketch6- Days(7), weeks(4), and months(12) are measured by one cycle through the track, the color change of the ball, and the value change of the background. In this way, it seems like each time a ball finishes the cycle a new ball comes in.
