Ideas
Sketch 1 - The goal of this was to compare the different types of colors used on each of the sketchbook pages

Sketch 2 - The goal is to compare the number of drawings (red boxes) versus text (blue boxes)

Sketch 3 - The goal is to compare ink to page ratio

Concept - The goal is to create a visual timeline by making changes similar to sketches 1-3 for all of individual sketchbook pages
